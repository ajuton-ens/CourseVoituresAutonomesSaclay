# Paris-Saclay Autonomous Car Race

Since 2020, the event has welcomed teams of students (from IUTs, engineer schools, universities) for a 1/10th scale autonomous car race, in a friendly and collaborative spirit. The prospect of final victory does not prevent teams from helping each other throughout the year with the aim of making collective progress.

The 1/10th scale autonomous cars are a fantastic platform for hands-on experimentation with artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning, supervised learning, imitation learning, unsupervised learning—AI in all its forms meets in Saclay every April.

Feel free to join the competition!
